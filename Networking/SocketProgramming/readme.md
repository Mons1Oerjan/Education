# Webserver
I built a webserver in Python by using the basics of socket programming.

## Running the server:
1. Using the command line interface, cd into the directory where the files are located, i.e:
      "cd dev/networking"
2. Run the following command: "python webserver.py"
3. The webserver is now running! You should receive a message in the console saying "Ready to serve..."

## Accessing the server's files:
1. Go to your browser and enter this link: localhost:6789/HelloWorld.html

Note: If you try to access a file that does not exist on the server, i.e.
localhost:6789/non_existing_file, then a 404 error will display in the browser.

## Shutting down the server:
1. Click on ctrl + c to shut down the server.
