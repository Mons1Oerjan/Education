I ran the training step 3000 iterations. Increasing this number would most likely
result in more accurate results. However, due to hardware limitations I chose to run it 3000 times
only and compare these results.

Script  Accuracy
conv1   0.9726%
conv2   0.9808%
conv3   0.9823%

The results show that the more convolutional layers and pooling layers we add, the better
accuracy results we get. The results here show that 2 layers yield better results than 1
layer, and 3 layers yield better results than 2 layers.

I also ran these scripts on 1000 training iterations, and the results showed the same
conclusion that the more layers we use, the better the results are.

Disclaimer: This theory has yet to be tested with more than 3 layers.
